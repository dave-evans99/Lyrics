            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white" data-pause="50">Verse 1</p>
            
            <p class="lyric">She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene</p>
            <p class="lyric">I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one</p>
            <p class="lyric">Who will dance on the floor in the round?</p>
            <p class="lyric">She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round</p>

            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white">Verse 2</p>
            <p class="lyric">She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene</p>
            <p class="lyric">Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one</p>
            <p class="lyric">Who will dance on the floor in the round</p>

            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white">B Section</p>

            <p class="lyric">People always told me be careful of what you do</p>
            <p class="lyric">And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts</p>
            <p class="lyric">And mother always told me be careful of who you love</p>
            <p class="lyric">And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth</p>

            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white">Chorus</p>

            <p class="lyric">Billie Jean is not my lover</p>
            <p class="lyric">She's just a girl who claims that I am the one</p>
            <p class="lyric">But the kid is not my son</p>
            <p class="lyric">She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son</p>

            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white">Verse 3</p>

            <p class="lyric">For forty days and forty nights</p>
            <p class="lyric">The law was on her side</p>
            <p class="lyric">But who can stand when she's in demand</p>
            <p class="lyric">Her schemes and plans</p>
            <p class="lyric">'Cause we danced on the floor in the round</p>
            <p class="lyric">So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice</p>
            <p class="lyric">(Do think twice, do think twice)</p>

            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white">Verse 4</p>

            <p class="lyric">She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me</p>
            <p class="lyric">Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)</p>
            <p class="lyric">'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby</p>

            <p class="lyric">People always told me be careful of what you do</p>
            <p class="lyric">And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts</p>
            <p class="lyric">She came and stood right by me</p>
            <p class="lyric">Just the smell of sweet perfume</p>
            <p class="lyric">This happened much too soon</p>
            <p class="lyric">She called me to her room</p>

            <p class="text pl-2 has-text-left has-background-info has-text-white">Chorus</p>
            <p class="lyric">Billie Jean is not my lover</p>

            <p class="lyric">She says I am the one</p>
            <p class="lyric">You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe</p>
            <p class="lyric">She says I am the one</p>
            <p class="lyric">Billie Jean is not my lover</p>
            <p class="lyric">Billie Jean is not my lover</p>
